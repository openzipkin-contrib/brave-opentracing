# OpenTracing Java Bridge for Zipkin

This library is a Java bridge between the [Brave/Zipkin Api](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/brave#brave-api-v4) and OpenTracing. It allows its users to write portable (in the [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io) sense) instrumentation that's translated into Brave instrumentation transparently.

## Compatibility

[opentracing-api](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-java) has broken compatibility
on most releases, which limits the ability for this project to provide a large version range.

Here are the versions currently available, noting only the latest version of
opentracing-api is likely to have new work in this repository.

Version | opentracing-api version
--------|-------------------------
0.34.0+ | 0.32.0, 0.33.0
0.33.13 | 0.31.0

## Required Reading

In order to understand OpenTracing Api, one must first be familiar with the [OpenTracing project](http://opentracing.io) and [terminology](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md) more generally.

To understand how Zipkin and Brave work, you can look at [Zipkin Architecture](http://zipkin.io/pages/architecture.html) and [Brave Api](https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/tree/master/brave#brave-api-v4) documentation.

## Setup

Firstly, you need a Tracer, configured to [report to Zipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java).

```java
// Configure a reporter, which controls how often spans are sent
//   (the dependency is io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3)
sender = OkHttpSender.create("http://127.0.0.1:9411/api/v2/spans");
spanReporter = AsyncReporter.create(sender);

// If you want to support baggage, create a field you would like to
// propagate and configure it with `BaggagePropagation`
COUNTRY_CODE = BaggageField.create("country-code");

// Baggage does not need to be sent remotely via headers, but if you configure
// with `addRemoteField()`, it will be
propagationFactory = BaggagePropagation.newFactoryBuilder(B3Propagation.FACTORY)
                                       .addRemoteField(COUNTRY_CODE)
                                       .build()

// Now, create a Brave tracing component with the service name you want to see in Zipkin.
//   (the dependency is io.zipkin.brave:brave)
braveTracing = Tracing.newBuilder()
                      .localServiceName("my-service")
                      .propagationFactory(propagationFactory)
                      .spanReporter(spanReporter)
                      .build();

// use this to create an OpenTracing Tracer
tracer = BraveTracer.create(braveTracing);
countryCode = span.getBaggageItem(COUNTRY_CODE.name());

// You can later unwrap the underlying Brave Api as needed
braveTracing = tracer.unwrap();
countryCode = COUNTRY_CODE.get(span.unwrap().context());
```

Note: If you haven't updated to a server running the [Zipkin v2 api](https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans), you
can use the old Zipkin format like this:

```java
sender = OkHttpSender.json("http://127.0.0.1:9411/api/v1/spans");
spanReporter = AsyncReporter.builder(sender).build(SpanEncoder.JSON_V1);
```
